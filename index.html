        <h3>Question-1 : Can you come up with an example of HTML portfolio template that you would like to use? Share the link with the professor and explain why you think this HTML template is good.
        <hr /></h3>
        <p><b>Answer : I would like to use one template from online. Here is the link : <a href="https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-creative/" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>. I think this HTML template is good because it is a bootstrap template , simple and I like it.</b></p>

        <h3>Question-2 : What change do you have to make to the portfolio template selected to accommodate to the project specifications? What sections would you have to add, remove or change somehow?
        <hr /></h3>
        <p><b>Answer : I have to change some sections for my project. Because it has no education, working experience and language spoken section and I have to remove one section, "At Your Service" that I don't need. I am going to edit the template according to the project requirement. Also I have to add the map section to the template.</b> </p>
        <h3>Question-3 : If the template does not come with skill gauges or similar, can you find which gauges you would like to use and send the link to the professor?
        <hr /></h3>
        <p><b>Answer : I want to add a double column to the "About Me" section to show a short bio in one column just like my real portfolio. And I would like to use skill gauges from my portfolio link : <a href="http://zjeme.techlaunch.io/" target="_blank">Zakia Afrin Jeme-Portfolio</a>.</b> </p>
